# SWIMM APP
Hello, welcome to my Capstone Project 02/2022 for [Neue Fische Bootcamp](https://github.com/neuefische/.


This app creates a customized swimming workout accordingly to your desires. It uses a database of exercises to generate a workout and displays everything you need to get your swimming day started. Create your workout, add swimming exercises, browse through training tips/videos, to be perfectly prepared for your pool workout.

## INSTALL 

SWIM APP in React and Express. It consists of a client directory holding the React App and a server directory which serves the API.

How to install and run:

1. `git clone REPO`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start both client and server in the dev environment
4. `npm run build` to build the client React app
5. `npm start` to run the server which serves the client and the API as if it's deployed

In order to persist data in MongoDB, please take a look in the `.env.example` and create an `.env` file locally holding your database credentials

_NOTE_: vite is by default installed as a dev dependency and in production (e.g. Heroku) dev dependencies are not installed!
In order to build the React App, Heroku needs vite which is not available, so it´s throwing an error.
To let know Heroku to install also dev dependencies, we need to set `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to `false`.

Set the Environment Variable `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to `false` in the `Config Vars` section in the Heroku user interface (your database credentials go there as well)  
– or –  
Using heroku cli: `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`  
– or –  
in the npm `postinstall` script we can add `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`  
– or –  
We can add vite as main dependency.
