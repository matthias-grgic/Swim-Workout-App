# SWIMM APP
Hello, welcome to my capstone project for Neue Fische (muc-web-21-3)


This app creates a customized swimming workout accordingly to your desires. It uses a database of exercises to generate a workout and displays everything you need to get your swimming day started. Create your workout, add swimming exercises, browse through training tips/videos, to be perfectly prepared for your pool workout.

##INSTALL 

SWIM APP in React and Express. It consists of a client directory holding the React App and a server directory which serves the API.

How to install and run:

1. `git clone REPO`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start both client and server in the dev environment
4. `npm run build` to build the client React app
5. `npm start` to run the server which serves the client and the API as if it's deployed

In order to persist data in MongoDB, please take a look in the `.env.example` and create an `.env` file locally holding your database credentials
